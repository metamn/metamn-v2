# Metamn V2

- This is currently deployed to metamn.io
- Playing with a more mainstream-looking portfolio idea.

## Deploy

- Couldn't run the gulp server
- Changed the production code manually (a link was replaced only)

## Notes

- The site is so huge Swig cannot compile all homepage sections.
  It seems they'll have to be concatenated manually.
- Tested only on landscape / large screens
